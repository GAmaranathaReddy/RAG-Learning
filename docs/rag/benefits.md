# Benefits of Retrieval augmented generation

RAG formulations can be applied to various NLP applications, including chatbots, question-answering systems, and content generation, where correct information retrieval and natural language generation are critical. The key advantages RAG provides include:
The RAG approach has a number of key benefits, including:

### Providing up-to-date and accurate responses

RAG ensures that the response of an LLM is not based solely on static, stale training data. Rather, the model uses up-to-date external data sources to provide responses.

### Reducing inaccurate responses, or hallucinations

By grounding the LLM model's output on relevant, external knowledge, RAG attempts to mitigate the risk of responding with incorrect or fabricated information (also known as hallucinations). Outputs can include citations of original sources, allowing human verification.

### Providing domain-specific, relevant responses

Using RAG, the LLM will be able to provide contextually relevant responses tailored to an organization's proprietary or domain-specific data.

### Being efficient and cost-effective

Compared to other approaches to customizing LLMs with domain-specific data, RAG is simple and cost-effective. Organizations can deploy RAG without needing to customize the model. This is especially beneficial when models need to be updated frequently with new data.

### Cost-effective implementation

Chatbot development typically begins using a foundation model. Foundation models (FMs) are API-accessible LLMs trained on a broad spectrum of generalized and unlabeled data. The computational and financial costs of retraining FMs for organization or domain-specific information are high. RAG is a more cost-effective approach to introducing new data to the LLM. It makes generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) technology more broadly accessible and usable.

### Current information

Even if the original training data sources for an LLM are suitable for your needs, it is challenging to maintain relevancy. RAG allows developers to provide the latest research, statistics, or news to the generative models. They can use RAG to connect the LLM directly to live social media feeds, news sites, or other frequently-updated information sources. The LLM can then provide the latest information to the users.

### Enhanced user trust

RAG allows the LLM to present accurate information with source attribution. The output can include citations or references to sources. Users can also look up source documents themselves if they require further clarification or more detail. This can increase trust and confidence in your generative AI solution.

### More developer control

With RAG, developers can test and improve their chat applications more efficiently. They can control and change the LLM's information sources to adapt to changing requirements or cross-functional usage. Developers can also restrict sensitive information retrieval to different authorization levels and ensure the LLM generates appropriate responses. In addition, they can also troubleshoot and make fixes if the LLM references incorrect information sources for specific questions. Organizations can implement generative AI technology more confidently for a broader range of applications.

### Improved relevance and accuracy

By incorporating a retrieval component, RAG models can access external knowledge sources, ensuring the generated text is grounded in accurate and up-to-date information. This leads to more contextually relevant and accurate responses, reducing hallucinations in question answering and content generation.

### Contextual coherence

Retrieval-based models provide context for the generation process, making generating coherent and contextually appropriate text easier. This leads to more cohesive and understandable responses, as the generation component can build upon the retrieved information.

### Handling open-domain queries

RAG models excel in taking open-domain questions where the required information may not be in the training data. The retrieval component can fetch relevant information from a vast knowledge base, allowing the model to provide answers or generate content on various topics.

### Reduced generation bias

Incorporating retrieval can help mitigate some inherent biases in purely generative models. By relying on existing information from a diverse range of sources, RAG models can generate less biased and more objective responses.

### Efficient computation

Retrieval-based models can be computationally efficient for tasks where the knowledge base is already available and structured. Instead of generating responses from scratch, they can retrieve and adapt existing information, reducing the computational cost.

### Multi-modal capabilities

RAG models can be extended to work with multiple modalities, such as text and images. This allows them to generate contextually relevant text to textual and visual content, opening up possibilities for applications in image captioning, content summarization, and more.

### Customization and fine-tuning

RAG models can be customized for specific domains or use cases. This adaptability makes them suitable for various applications, including domain-specific chatbots, customer support, and information retrieval systems.

### Human-AI Collaboration

RAG models can assist humans in information retrieval tasks by quickly summarizing and presenting relevant information from a knowledge base, reducing the time and effort required for manual search.
