# How can AWS support your Retrieval-Augmented Generation requirements?

[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a fully-managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models—along with a broad set of capabilities—to build generative AI applications while simplifying development and maintaining privacy and security. With knowledge bases for Amazon Bedrock, you can connect FMs to your data sources for RAG in just a few clicks. Vector conversions, retrievals, and improved output generation are all handled automatically.

For organizations managing their own RAG, [Amazon Kendra](https://aws.amazon.com/kendra/) is a highly-accurate enterprise search service powered by machine learning. It provides an optimized Kendra [Retrieve API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/APIReference/API_Retrieve.html) that you can use with Amazon Kendra’s high-accuracy semantic ranker as an enterprise retriever for your RAG workflows. For example, with the Retrieve API, you can:

Retrieve up to 100 semantically-relevant passages of up to 200 token words each, ordered by relevance.
Use pre-built connectors to popular data technologies like [Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), SharePoint, Confluence, and other websites.
Support a wide range of document formats such as HTML, Word, PowerPoint, PDF, Excel, and text files.
Filter responses based on those documents that the end-user permissions allow.
Amazon also offers options for organizations who want to build more custom generative AI solutions. [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/jumpstart/) JumpStart is a ML hub with FMs, built-in algorithms, and prebuilt ML solutions that you can deploy with just a few clicks. You can speed up RAG implementation by referring to existing SageMaker notebooks and code examples.
